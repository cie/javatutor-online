    # Hello, World!

    Welcome and thanks for participating! 
    This is a warm-up task so you can get familiar with the environment.
    Whenever you are stuck, feel free to use the yellow hand button to ask for help.

    **Write a program that asks for the name of the user and then greets them.**

    You can run the program with the green Run button and see its output in the Output box.

    The Input box below contains the user input that will be sent to your program when you press Run:
    one line in the box is one line entered.
  initialCode: |
    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class Code {
        public static void main(String [] args) {
            Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
            System.out.println("Enter your name: ");
            String name = input.nextLine();
            
        }
    }
  input: $NAME
  hints:
    - hint: You should call nextLine()
      spec: '! calls nextLine'
    - hint: Use System.out.println()
      spec: count(does console print) <= 1
      yes:

                  System.out.println("Enter your name: ");
                  String name = input.nextLine();
                  
              }

                  System.out.println();
