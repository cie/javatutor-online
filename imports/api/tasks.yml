    Welcome and thanks for participating! 
    This is a warm-up task so you can get familiar with the environment.

    **Write a program that asks for the name of the user and then greets them.**

    You can run the program with the Run button and see its output in the Output box.

    The Input box below contains the input the user would enter into the running program:
    one line in the box is one line entered. These will be sent to the running program.
