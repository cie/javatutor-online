    Welcome and thanks for participating! 
    This is a warm-up task so you can get familiar with the environment.

    You can run the program with the green Run button and see its output in the Output box.

    The Input box below contains the user input that will be sent to your program when you press Run:
    one line in the box is one line entered.
